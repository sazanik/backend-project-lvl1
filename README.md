# Brain Games

**Brain Games** is a collection of five console-based mini-games designed to boost cognitive skills, similar to popular brain-training mobile apps. Each game presents questions requiring correct answers. The game is considered completed once a player provides three correct answers. A single incorrect answer ends the game and offers a chance to try again.

1. **Calculator**: Solve arithmetic expressions.
2. **Progression**: Find the missing number in a sequence.
3. **Even Check**: Determine if a number is even.
4. **Greatest Common Divisor**: Calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
5. **Prime Check**: Determine if a number is prime.
